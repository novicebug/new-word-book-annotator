------ PENDING ------

- Move the 3 buttons for add, edit and delete on one row to free up space.

- Add a scrollable container round the word details so it only scrolls them and not the book list, the search and the buttons below.

- How to make saving of word know where it is saving? Probably add a drop down with the books VL and select the current book. 

- Allow adding a searched word to a book. E.g. searching in all books and find a word by clicking a button go to Add/Edit so you can provide another location in the newly selected book.

- Have a listbox with the available books on the left. Have an option to select all.

- When a concrete book is selected in the filter, i.e. other than "---ALL---" option, then check if the searched word is met in other books and if yes mark the word in the details in some way, for example chage its background so that this notifies that the word is met in other places as well.

- Add binding for current Word on Home page and on Add/Edit page. Probably the HomeWindow needs to implement INotifyPropertyChanged and raise the event when setting the CurrentWord property.

- In the HomeWindow's constructor generate dynamically the example controls based on the constant of there size and add them to the containing grid.
